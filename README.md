# Fine-Tuning Example for AI Support Agent :milky_way:

This repository contains a sample JSONL file intended for fine-tuning language models, particularly in the context of building an AI support agent for corporate legal questions. The examples provided in the file represent a simplified structure for training the model to understand how to handle user queries and generate relevant responses based on corporate law regulations.

## Purpose :pushpin:

The JSONL file (*training.jsonl*) in this repository is meant as a demonstration of the format required for fine-tuning a model, such as those provided by OpenAI. Fine-tuning allows a base model to specialize in answering a specific type of query—in this case, legal and corporate-related questions.

Please note:
The examples in this file are not exhaustive. In a real-world scenario, you would need to provide many more examples to achieve a well-rounded and effective fine-tuning process. Additionally, it may be necessary to create a separate validation file for testing and validation purposes.

### Format of the JSONL

The file is structured using a **messages** object that contains exchanges between different roles (i.e., the **system**, **user**, and **assistant**). Here’s a breakdown of the format:
```json
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "x"}, {"role": "user", "content": "x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "x"}]}
```
```json
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI support agent, specializing in resolving legal questions related to corporate law and regulations. Always be polite, concise, and ensure you provide clear and legally accurate instructions to the users."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who do you think is the greatest football player of all time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello,\nThank you for the fun question, but sports debates are not within my skill set. I specialize in legal questions and corporate regulations. If you have any legal concerns or inquiries, I'd be happy to assist!\nBest regards, Legal Support Team."}]}
```


**system role**: Provides instructions to the AI on how to behave or respond.

**user role**: Represents the end user's question or inquiry.

**assistant role**: Represents the response generated by the AI model.

## Expanding the Dataset
While the current file offers several examples, a robust dataset for fine-tuning should contain many more exchanges covering a wide range of user inputs. This will help the model generalize better and perform more effectively across different scenarios.

Additionally, you might want to create a validation dataset to verify the model’s performance. This dataset would be structured similarly to the training file but used solely for testing purposes after the fine-tuning process.

## How to Use
Prepare your own examples in this format, covering as many potential user queries as possible.
Ensure that the data is structured properly and adheres to the JSONL format.
Use this file as input when fine-tuning your model, and optionally create a validation file for testing.
Run the fine-tuning process using your preferred platform (e.g., OpenAI’s fine-tuning API).

## Example Use Case
The file in this repository is designed for fine-tuning a support agent to assist with legal questions within a corporate setting. However, the structure can be adapted for a variety of other use cases by simply modifying the examples to suit your desired domain.
